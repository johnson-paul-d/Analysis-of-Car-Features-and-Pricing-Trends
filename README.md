# Analysis-of-Car-Features-and-Pricing-Trends
This analysis demonstrates my ability to clean data, create meaningful visualizations, and provide insights that translate raw data into a clear story about vehicle market trends.

- In this project, I analyzed a dataset of car specifications and pricing information to uncover trends and patterns within the automotive market, utilizing my skills as a Data Analyst. Through data cleaning, I ensured the dataset’s consistency by handling missing values in crucial columns such as Engine HP and Engine Cylinders. I then explored various aspects of vehicle features, including style, engine type, and MSRP (Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price), to draw meaningful insights.

- The analysis involved visualizations created with Seaborn and Plotly to reveal pricing and feature patterns across different car styles. One of the main visualizations was a histogram of MSRP values by Vehicle Style, highlighting how luxury SUVs, convertibles, and high-performance coupes typically feature higher price tags compared to sedans and hatchbacks. Using Seaborn and Plotly’s interactive plotting capabilities, I was able to showcase this pricing disparity, making it easy to identify which vehicle types are priced at a premium.

- Further insights included examining Engine Cylinders, where a clear trend emerged: most compact cars have four-cylinder engines, while larger vehicles such as trucks and SUVs more commonly have six or eight-cylinder engines. This correlation between engine type and vehicle style provided a deeper understanding of car manufacturers’ design choices based on functionality and target market segments.

- Overall, this project demonstrates my expertise in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling. Through this analysis, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the automotive market, revealing how vehicle features influence pricing. This project was executed using Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn and Plotly for visualizations, effectively translating raw data into actionable insights and visually engaging stories about the car industry.


## Key Skills and Tools Used:

Python Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib
Data Cleaning: Identified and filled missing values for key columns such as Engine HP and Engine Cylinders
Data Visualization: Created interactive and static plots for MSRP and other vehicle attributes to observe pricing trends across vehicle styles
Statistical Analysis: Generated summary statistics and visual distributions to better understand the pricing and feature distribution

## Visualizations and Findings:

MSRP Distribution by Vehicle Style: Histogram of MSRP values across different vehicle styles using Seaborn and Plotly, highlighting how different styles impact pricing.
Engine Cylinder Insights: Identified trends in engine types across various vehicle models and filled missing values to ensure data consistency.
Interactive Exploration: Utilized Plotly’s interactive capabilities for an in-depth look at pricing and feature correlations.
